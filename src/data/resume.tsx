    "Hey! I’m Rifky, a student in SIJA (Information Systems, Networks, and Applications). Honestly, I’m not that into coding — I prefer planting and taking care of plants. It’s just more relaxing and fun for me. I also like joining organizations, meeting new people, and working on cool stuff together. Oh, and I can speak a bit of Japanese, just the basic stuff though 😅.",
